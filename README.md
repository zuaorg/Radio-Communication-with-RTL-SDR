# Radio-Communication-with-RTL-SDR
# A software defined radio differs from a traditional radio in several ways. The biggest difference is in how RF is detected and demodulated. 
# An SDR uses a quadrature sampling detector (QSD) that divides the incoming waveform into an in-phase and quadrature signal. The in-phase signal is the first 90ยบ of the RF sine wave and the quadrature signal is the second 90ยบ segment of the RF sine wave.
# SDR has several advantages over traditional radios.
